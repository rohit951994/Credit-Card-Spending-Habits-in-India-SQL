**1. Write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends**

   Mumbai , Bangalore and Ahmeedabad are the top 3 cities with highest credit card spends
   
**2. Write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type**
   ![ans2](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/49bdd34b-bf64-41c5-8e15-cf77d1b91321)
  
  This is done by first identifying the month in which maximum spending happened by grouping the data on month and doing sum of spending putting a limit on the output and then using this output as a filter in other query where we group the data on cards .
  
**3. Write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)**
   ![ans 3](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/847189c3-876a-4c3c-b421-c4976545d6ad)
 
 Firstly we start the problem by creating a CTE cumulative_txn_sum where we find the cumulative sum of all the transaction partitioned on card_type and ordered by date_of_transaction .Then we create another CTE conditional_flag where we flag the enteries where the cumulative sun reaches 1000000 using case statement and lag windows function and then we just filter out the flagged data .

**4. Write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type**
  ![ans4](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/1692c5ab-a56a-4f2e-90d2-52da67b4a762)

**5. Write a query to print 3 columns: city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)**
   ![ans5](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/d2adc2e3-4783-4feb-851c-1bfc9e914ef8)
   
   [10 samples shown] 
   
   First we create a CTE to find the total spending grouped on city and expense_type . After that we pivot the data by using case statement and first_value and last_value functions to to arrange the data into different category .
   
**6. Write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type**
   ![ans6](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/77d2328e-7e25-4571-bdeb-61f3ca1e9278)
   
   In this problem we cteate two CTEs . total_expense , where total_Expense is found based on txpense_Type and Total_expense_by_female . Then the data from two CTEs are joined to find the percentage contribution by Female .

**7. Which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014**
   ![ans7](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/4e8c4369-3840-47a1-9550-449bdef3cfb1)

**8. During weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio**
   ![ans8](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/ff60e474-ab96-4d58-9af0-b0d79e253e1f)

**9. Which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after first transaction in that city**
   
   ![ans9](https://github.com/rohit951994/Credit-Card-Spending-Habits-in-India-SQL/assets/72706872/ad24d3ef-e573-4340-bb9d-d6c034b718cc)
